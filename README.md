Transparent evaluation criteria for team-based work

## Evaluation Layer (Smart Interns Only)

This repository defines the evaluation framework for applied Smart Interns.

Important clarifications:

- Evaluation is conducted at an individual level, not at a team level
- Smart Interns may collaborate with:
  - Non-applicants
  - International contributors
  - Alumni
- Team participation does not guarantee evaluation

Only individuals who have applied as Smart Interns may be tracked for evaluation.
